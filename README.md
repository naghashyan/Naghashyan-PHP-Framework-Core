NGS (Naghashyan Framework)�is a high performance, component-based PHP framework for rapidly developing modern Web applications.�

is NGS Best for?

NGS�is a generic Web programming framework, meaning that it can be used for developing all kinds of Web applications using PHP. Because of its component-based architecture and sophisticated caching support, it is especially suitable for developing large-scale applications such as portals, forums, content management systems (CMS), e-commerce projects, RESTful Web services, and so on.

## How does NGS�Compare with Other Frameworks?

If you're already familiar with another framework, you may appreciate knowing how NGS�compares:

*   Like most PHP frameworks, NGS�implements the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern and promotes code organization based on that pattern.
*   NGS�takes the philosophy that code should be written in a simple yet elegant way. NGS�will never try to over-design things mainly for the purpose of strictly following some design pattern.
*   NGS�is a full-stack framework providing many proven and ready-to-use features: query builders and ActiveRecord for both relational and NoSQL databases; RESTful API development support; multi-tier caching support; and more.
*   NGS�is extremely extensible. You can customize or replace nearly every piece of the core's code. You can also take advantage of NGS's�solid extension architecture to use or develop redistributable extensions.
*   High performance is always a primary goal of NGS.

## Requirements and Prerequisites�

NGS�requires PHP 7.4.0 or above. You can find more detailed requirements for individual features by running the requirement checker included in every NGS�release.

Using NGS�requires basic knowledge of object-oriented programming (OOP), as NGS�is a pure OOP-based framework. NGS�also makes use of the latest features of PHP, such as�[namespaces](http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.php)�and�[traits](http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.traits.php). Understanding these concepts will help you more easily pick up NGS.
